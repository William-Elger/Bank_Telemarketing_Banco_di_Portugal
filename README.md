# Bank_Telemarketing_Banco_di_Portugal
Analysis of 2014 telemarketing campaign run by Banco di Portugal on 41,188 of their clients

This is the result of a project I set myself to practise analysing data with Python and using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize any findings.

The original data is publicly available for research here: https://www.kaggle.com/henriqueyamahata/bank-marketing

This repositry contains the following:
- PowerPoint presentation outlining the project and showcasing visualizations and findings
- Png files of the visualizations
- Jupyter Notebook and .py files with my code
- The original dataset (.csv)
- The readme that came with the dataset (.txt)
